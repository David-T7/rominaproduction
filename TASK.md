# Romina PLC — Task List

> Tasks are split across 3 team members. Complete **Person 1** tasks first — they unblock everyone else.
> Check off tasks as you finish them: change `[ ]` to `[x]`.

---

## Person 1 — Structure & Cleanup

- [x] **Task 1 — Remove duplicate home route**
  Delete the first `Route::get('/')` closure in `routes/web.php` (line 17).
  Keep only the `PagesController::home` route below it.

- [x] **Task 2 — Sub-page routes**
  Site is a SPA — all sections live on the home page via anchor links.
  Sub-page routes commented out in `routes/web.php` (can be uncommented if needed later).

- [x] **Task 3 — Split the main layout into partials**
  `resources/views/layouts/mainlayout.blade.php` is ~2500 lines.
  Break it into `@include` partials under `resources/views/partials/`:
  - `header.blade.php`
  - `hero.blade.php`
  - `about.blade.php`
  - `who-we-are.blade.php`
  - `culture.blade.php`
  - `executive-team.blade.php`
  - `businesses.blade.php`
  - `sustainability.blade.php`
  - `portfolio.blade.php`
  - `footer.blade.php`

  > ⚠️ Agree on these file names with the team **before** starting — Person 2 and Person 3 will be editing those same files.

- [x] **Task 4 — Implement mobile menu JavaScript**
  The `.mobile-menu-button` (hamburger) is in the header but nothing wires it up.
  - Toggle an `open` class on `.main-navigation` when the button is clicked
  - Close the nav when any nav link is clicked
  - Handle the mega menu dropdown on mobile too

- [ ] **Task 5 — Fix "Business Group" branding**
  Two places have the wrong name in `mainlayout.blade.php`:
  - `<title>Business Group</title>` → change to `<title>{{ $pageTitle }}</title>`
  - Footer copyright: `"© {{ date('Y') }} Business Group."` → `"Romina Group"`

- [ ] **Task 20 — Audit missing images**
  Check which of these actually exist under `public/images/`:
  - `hero/hero-01.jpg`, `hero-02.jpg`, `hero-03.jpg`
  - `about/romina-history.jpg`
  - `team/executive-01.jpg` through `executive-04.jpg`
  - `portfolio/jaguar.jpg`

  List what's missing and flag to the team. Check `src/assets/` in the React project for anything usable.

## Person 2 — New Content Sections

- [ ] **Task 6 — Update the mega menu**

  1. **Restaurants & Culinary Brands** — Romina Restaurants, KOBA, Meskott *(Hospitality in Addis Ababa since 1973.)*
  2. **Romina Coffee** — Romina Coffee *(Ethiopian Arabica, exported since 2009.)*
  3. **Romina Imports** — Romina Imports *(Quality FMCG imported for local consumption.)*

  **Export journey bar:**

    - *"This season's harvest update"* — Coffee harvest

    - *"Community project update"* — CSR
    - *"Group announcement"* — Group news
  - Filtering via vanilla JS (no page reload). Active tab highlighted in red.

- [ ] **Task 10 — Add Careers section**
  Add with `id="careers"` so the nav link resolves.
  Heading + short copy about working at Romina Group + a CTA button (email or link).
  Placeholder content is fine for now.

- [ ] **Task 11 — Add Partners section**
  Add before the footer. Highlight the Jaquar Group partnership.
  Placeholder logos if real assets aren't available yet.

- [ ] **Task 19 — Update Portfolio cards with real copy**
  Replace the placeholder text in the 4 portfolio cards:

  | Card | Title | Body | Pills |

  | 01 | Restaurant management & hospitality | Home-styled dishes, warm service and three distinct culinary brands across Addis Ababa. | Romina Restaurants, KOBA, Meskott |
  | 02 | Coffee exporting | Arabica from seven growing regions, sourced from over 30,000 farmers, exported across four continents. | Romina Coffee |
  | 03 | International trading services | Grown out of our hospitality operations into a dedicated importer of quality FMCG for local consumption. | Romina Imports |
